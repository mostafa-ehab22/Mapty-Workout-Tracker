# Mapty 🗺️

**Mapty** is a web-based application that allows users to track their running and cycling workouts by pinpointing locations on a map. The app uses the **Leaflet library** for rendering maps and markers and leverages the **Geolocation API** to capture the user's current position. Workouts are stored in **local storage**, ensuring they persist between sessions.

## Features 🌟

- **Leaflet Map Integration**: Display maps and allow users to mark workout locations.
- **Geolocation API**: Automatically detect and display the user’s current location on the map.
- **Local Storage API**: Workouts are saved locally, and users can retrieve their data on their next login.
- **Running & Cycling Workouts**: Users can log their workouts (either running or cycling) with additional data like distance, time, and cadence.
- **Form-Based Input**: A workout form is displayed when a location is clicked on the map, where users can input workout data.
- **Move to Marker**: Click on a workout in the workout list to move the map to the corresponding marker location.
